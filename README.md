# My_Portfolio
DESCRIPTION:
Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Saurabh Mishra . This website showcases some of my best work and highlights my skills and experience.
The design of this website is clean and modern, with a simple color scheme of black, yellow, and dark green. The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, making it easy to view on any device.


* I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website. The HTML provides the structure of the website, while the CSS is responsible for styling and design. The JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic features.

* Some of the features of this website include a navigation menu that makes it easy to find what you're looking for, a portfolio section that showcases my work, and a contact form that allows you to get in touch with me.

* I tested this website on different browsers and devices to ensure that it works properly. I encountered some issues with the layout on mobile devices, but I was able to fix them by using media queries.

* Overall, creating this portfolio website was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot about web development and gained valuable skills that I can use in my future projects.
